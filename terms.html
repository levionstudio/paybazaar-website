                data.
            </p>

            <h4>Eligibility </h4>
            <p>You further represent and confirm that you are not a person debarred from using the PAYBAZAAR website

            <p>You must choose a reasonably descriptive Username that clearly identifies you or your business. This name
                may appear on the Buyer Account statement. If a Transaction dispute results from your failure to use a
                reasonably descriptive username, you agree to indemnify PAYBAZAAR for any costs stemming from such
                dispute. As part of the PAYBAZAAR registration process, you will create a password for your Sambhav

                including, without limitation, all actions by sub-users registered under the PAYBAZAAR Account. You

                Account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your PAYBAZAAR Account at

                of the PAYBAZAAR Account. In the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to ownership of a
                particular PAYBAZAAR Account, you agree that PAYBAZAAR will be the sole arbiter of such dispute, at
                its sole discretion and that PAYBAZAAR's decision (which may include termination or suspension of any
                account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.
